For now
    Debug: Why is moving pieces broken, as well as submit css

New workflow
    Normal moves, no change to board
    Css moves render board, before the board is rendered we modify the board state
        This modified board state is obtained during the move checking
        We save a copy of the actual board though

Misc
    Get rid of is light turn for the baord ele

Board state save, undo functions
    Create a function which generates a custom board layout / a saved board layout.

Code best practices
    Consider adding more debugging for which piece is putting the king in check "The king is in check due to: knight."
        Consider double checks

Functional CSS chess
    Html to board state needs to account for CSS in the board state

Making CSS nicer
    Fade animations for the switch turn buttons
    Sounds for pieces moving and so on

Chess edge cases
    Pawn promotions
    En passant
    Castling

Bugs
