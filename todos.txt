    Create a function which generates a custom board layout / a saved board layout.

Code best practices
    Consider making a class to reduce variable passing
    Consider adding more debugging for which piece is putting the king in check "The king is in check due to: knight."
        Consider double checks

CSS based

    Html to board state needs to account for CSS in the board state
    Board state needs to be used
    Move the piece from id to class as well
